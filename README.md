# Sales-ETL-Pipeline
This project demonstrates an end-to-end ETL (Extract, Transform, Load) pipeline for sales data using Python and Apache Airflow. The pipeline extracts raw data, performs necessary transformations, and loads the cleaned data into a target database or storage. The workflow is orchestrated using Airflow DAGs, providing scheduling, monitoring, and logging capabilities.

The project also includes:

Python scripts for ETL logic

Airflow DAG file to automate the pipeline

requirements.txt for managing dependencies

Deployment commands script to initialize Airflow, start the webserver, scheduler, and trigger DAGs
